The files contained in the compressed archive provide syntax highlighting for Axiom CAS input files.

Pamphlet files are also supported: you can thus have latex syntax highlight in latex text and Axiom syntax highlight in Axiom code inserted inside a "chunk" environment.

For another syntax file for axiom, see also
